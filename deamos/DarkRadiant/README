DarkRadiant
===========

DarkRadiant is a level (map) editor for the The Dark Mod, an open-source Doom 3
modification which is available at http://www.thedarkmod.com

Compiling on Windows
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

DarkRadiant is built on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 or Visual C++ 2010. 
The free Express version can be obtained here:

VC++ 2012: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-express-windows-desktop
VC++ 2010: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express

Since DarkRadiant uses a lot of open-source libraries that are not available on
Windows by default, you will also need to download and install the
dependencies. 7-Zip packages of the dependencies are available at the following
URL(s):

32-bit only builds:
https://github.com/downloads/orbweaver/DarkRadiant/w32deps.7z

64-bit builds:
https://github.com/downloads/orbweaver/DarkRadiant/w32deps.7z
https://github.com/downloads/orbweaver/DarkRadiant/w64deps.7z

Note that 64-bit builds need the 32-bit dependencies in addition to their own
64-bit dependencies.

The dependencies packages need to be extracted into the main DarkRadiant
source directory, i.e. alongside the include/ and radiant/ directories.

Build
-----

The main Visual C++ solution file is:

Visual Studio 2012: tools/msvc2012/DarkRadiant.sln
Visual Studio 2010: tools/msvc2010/DarkRadiant.sln

Open this file with Visual Studio and start a build by right-clicking on the
top-level "Solution 'DarkRadiant'" item and choosing Build Solution.
